# DeepCSCPR
#This package is the testing data and codes for the paper ‘DeepCSCPR: Deep convolutional sparse coding phase retrieval’.
Requirements and Dependencies
Python 3.7 or latter
PyTorch 0.4
GPU 1080Ti
Windows 10

Run the following demo function to test the model. -TestDeepCSC.py

#Note -1. We provide three trained models including noise level 10, 15 and 20.  
-2. Since the noise is random, the PSNR may be perturbed. This phenomenon is reasonable for non-convex problems.
If you encounter any problems, please do not hesitate to contact me.
